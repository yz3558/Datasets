And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet I may never know that either until I'm dead For now, though, what I do know Is although I don't deserve you Not you at your best and your splendor With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion Not you at your worst Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you You see, I have no mother And you do A continental shelf A larger piece of land from where you came And I? I'm an orphan A little seashell that rests upon your native shores One of many, for sure But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone For that reason, let me love you Don't mind my desperation Let me hold you, not just for vacation But for real and for forever Make it real life Let me be a real wife to you Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend I adore you Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness I'm generally quite quiet Quite a meditator, actually I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure I promise you'll barely even notice me Unless you want to notice me Unless you prefer a rambunctious child In which case, I can turn it on too I'm quite good on the stage as you may know You might have heard of me So either way, I'll fit in just fine So just love me by doing nothing And perhaps, by not shaking the county line I'm yours if you'll have me But regardless, you're mine",['Lana Del Rey'],"['Jack Antonoff', 'Lana Del Rey']","['Non-Music', 'Literature', 'Contemporary Poetry', 'Ambient', 'Poetry', 'Spoken Word']"

The portside” I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don’t trust yourself” But he didn’t, so I said it for him “I don’t trust myself” He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level “It’s not that you don’t trust yourself” he said. “it’s simply that you’re not a captain. It isn’t what you do” Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better “Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked “To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied “Okay. When you’re in the Ralphs in the Palisades, I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store, To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing Now, I don’t want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot, but everywhere you go, I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from And then, determine if it’s from the port or starboard side, So when you’re back on the boat you have a better sense of it” I thought his advice was adorable I could already picture myself in the parking lot, Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself I thought of mentioning it, but I didn’t Because captain’s aren’t like poets They don’t make metaphors between sea and sky And as I thought that to myself, I realized that’s why I write All of this circumnavigating the earth, Was to get back to my life Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise I’m not a captain, I’m not a pilot I write!

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner Quiet World War One, aviation pilot I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important Paradise is very fragile, and it seems like it's only getting worse Our leader is a megalomaniac , And we've seen that before But never 'cause it was what the country deserved My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture, but it's either that or I 5150 myself They don't understand I'm a dreamer And I had big dreams for the country Not for what it could do, but how it could feel How it could think, how it could dream I know Who am I to dream for you? It’s just that in my own mind I was born with a little bit of paradise I was lucky in that way Not like my husband Who was born and raised in hell I always had something gentle to give All of me, in fact It’s one of the beautiful things about me It's one of the beautiful things about nature But lately I’ve been thinking that I wish Someone had told me when I was younger More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise That should they take too much, There would be nothing left to give Not everyone's nature is golden and green And you can't fight what's in your nature I got to thinking about it as We were fighting the fires in Agora But I’m tired of fighting you Paradise is very fragile, and it's only getting worse And every time I think of that, I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve, She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree And this summer night, you in front of me, Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil Because you take and you take and you take and you take, But you taste like the beach and a kiss Candy from my eyes In my veins you run citrus Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees Arise in my midst Kundalini , you breathe me I could do this forever But my heart is very fragile, and I have nothing left to give",['Lana Del Rey'],"['Lana Del Rey', 'Jack Antonoff']","['Non-Music', 'Literature', 'Ambient', 'Contemporary Poetry', 'Spoken Word', 'Poetry']"

Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they started to believe them But anyways - that's all over now I've moved on, gone scorched earth And now I'm left wondering where to go from here To Sonoma where the fires have just left? South Dakota? Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great American homecoming I never had? Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place of the warm embrace I've never got? Or should I just be here now Bare feet on linoleum Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn into stew People love my stories People love visions",['Lana Del Rey'],"['Lana Del Rey', 'Jack Antonoff']","['Non-Music', 'Literature', 'Ambient', 'Contemporary Poetry', 'Poetry', 'Spoken Word']"
